# fgroups
Rust implementation of "fgroups" assignment for URI CSC411

This can be installed, once rust is installed, by running `cargo install --path fgroups` after cloning this repo.

Performance on the CSC411 homework server is about twice as fast as my C implementation of fgroups;
I assume Hanson's Table implementation isn't heavily optimized.
